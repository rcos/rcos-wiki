# Posix SH

**Website**: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell>

On most UNIX-like systems there `/bin/sh`, a symbolic link to system\'s
default [POSIX](/topics/POSIX) shell.

`/bin/sh` links to `Bash` on most systems, but on Ubuntu it links to
`Dash` (another POSIX compliant shell) for efficiency purposes.

## Historical Notes

Historically, `sh` was its own shell, called the Bourne Shell.

`Bash` (Bourne Again Shell) was made as an extension of `sh`, and has
since overtaken it as the widely accepted standard. The Bourne Shell is
no longer used on most systems, as `/bin/sh` is now a symbolic link.
