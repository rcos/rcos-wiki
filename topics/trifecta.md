# Web Trifecta

The so-called \"Web Trifecta\" is the three primary languages that can
be understood and run by modern web browsers. These are:

-   [HTML](/languages/HTML)
-   [CSS](/languages/CSS)
-   [JavaScript](/languages/JavaScript)

These three languages together form the content, style, and
functionality of web sites.

While there are a number of other languages that can be used for
frontend web development, in most cases those languages transpile to one
of the above.
