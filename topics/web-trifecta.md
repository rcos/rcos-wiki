The so-called "Web Trifecta" is the three primary languages that can
be understood and run by modern web browsers. These are:

- [HTML](/languages/html)
- [CSS](/languages/css)
- [JavaScript](/languages/javascript)

These three languages together form the content, style, and functionality of web sites.

While there are a number of other languages that can be used for frontend web development, in most cases those languages transpile to one of the above.
