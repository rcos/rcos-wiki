# Linux

**Website**: <https://www.kernel.org/>

\"Linux\" refers to two related but notably separate things: the Linux
kernel, and the GNU/Linux family of operating systems.

## Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is an [operating system kernel](/topics/opsys#kernel)
started in 1996 by [Linus Torvalds](/groups-people/Linus Torvalds) and
maintained by him and contributors to this day.

## GNU/Linux Operating System

The GNU/Linux family of operating systems, which is what is most
commonly meant when referring to \"Linux\", are operating systems using
the Linux kernel and the [GNU](/groups-people/GNU) userland tools.

### Distributions

GNU/Linux comes in the form of a variety of
[distributions](/topics/linux/distros) or \"distros\" created by a
variety of organizations. A list of popular distros can be found on the
[distros](/topics/linux/distros) page.
