"Linux" refers to two related but notably separate things: the Linux kernel, and the GNU/Linux family of operating systems.

## Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is an [operating system kernel](/topics/opsys#kernel) started in 1996 by [Linus Torvalds](/groups-people/Linus Torvalds) and maintained by him and contributors to this day.

## GNU/Linux Operating System

The GNU/Linux family of operating systems, which is what is most commonly meant when referring to \"Linux\", are operating systems using the Linux kernel and the [GNU](/groups-people/GNU) userland tools.

## Distributions
