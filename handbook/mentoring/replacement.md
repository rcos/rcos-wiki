# Mentor Replacement Policy

We understand that mentors and Coordinators may leave during the semester due to unforeseen circumstances. The following document establishes protocol for when mentors leave during the semester.

Please note that this policy is a work in progress.

## Overview
- Mentor Waitlist
- Replacing Coordinators
- Replacing Mentors
  - First Month
  - Mid-semester
  - Final 3 Weeks

See [issue #55](https://github.com/rcos/rcos-handbook/issues/55) for more information. 

## Mentor Waitlist

Before the start of each semester, if there are more applications for mentorship than we have available mentor slots, create a mentor waitlist. 

Students who are placed on the mentor waitlist should be considered an "understudy" to the current mentors. They may be taken off the waitlist if a current mentor leaves within the first month of the semester. 

If there are still people on the waitlist after the first month of the semester, they will be considered for mentorship for the following semester. If someone on the waitlist will be on co-op or study abroad for the following semester, they will be considered for mentorship for the semester that they return.

## Replacing Coordinators

If a Coordinator leaves at any point during the semester, a new Coordinator may be selected from the current mentors. Any mentors considered must have at least 1-2 semesters' worth of mentorship experience.

If a Coordinator resigns, is terminated, or is suspended/expelled from Rensselaer due to severe and repeated Code of Conduct and/or RPI Student Handbook violations, Faculty Advisors must select a new Coordinator to prevent conflicts of interest.

In all other circumstances, the current Coordinators, including the Coordinator leaving, may assist in selecting a new Coordinator.

Since Coordinators are mentors as well, the mentor replacement policy below outlines the protocol for choosing a new mentor or moving mentors between small groups.

## Replacing Mentors

Mentor replacement depends on how much time is left in the semester due to time constraints.

### First Month

During the first month of the semester, we have a lot of flexibility as to replacing mentors.

If there is a mentor waitlist, a student will be chosen from the waitlist to fill the gap in leadership. 

If there is no waitlist, an emergency mentorship application will be sent out and the new mentor will be selected from the applicants.

If there is no waitlist and we do not get any applicants from the emergency application within 1 full week, we may follow the mid-semester procedure of moving mentors between small groups. 

If applicants or waitlist members have not been mentors before, they must undergo mentor training. If the last mentor training session has already passed, they may schedule a one-on-one debrief/training session with a Coordinator. 

If a mentor resigns, is terminated, or is suspended/expelled from Rensselaer due to severe and repeated Code of Conduct and/or RPI Student Handbook violations, it is solely the Coordinators' and Faculty Advisors' responsibility to choose a new mentor from the waitlist or from the emergency application. If the mentor in question is also a Coordinator or a Coordinator was also involved in the violations, Faculty Advisors must select a new mentor.

In all other circumstances, the mentor leaving as well as the other mentors in their small group may assist in selecting a new mentor.

## Mid-semester

If a month has already passed since the start of the semester, no new appointments can be made. However, we may switch mentors between small groups.

If a project has no more than 3 or 4 members, including a mentor, the entire project team will receive a request to move to the small group missing a mentor.

If a project has multiple mentors on the team, and there is an excess of mentors in the projects' small group, one of the mentors from that team as well as a few team members will receive a request to move to the other small group.

If no current mentors agree to switch small groups within one week, a new appointment may be made following the procedure above. If after one week of following the procedure above, there is no waitlist and we have no new applicants, we will not appoint any new mentors unless the mentor shortage results in 1 mentor in a small group.

> **TODO**: determine what constitutes an 'excess' in mentors

## Final 3 Weeks

During the final 3 weeks of the semester, no appointment or small group mentor changes may be made unless the departure of a mentor results in only 1 mentor in a small group. In that case, we may follow the mid-semester procedure.
