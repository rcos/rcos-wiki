# Mentors

!> While remote learning is in effect, mentor responsibilities are somewhat lessened as there are no in-person meetings. Instead, it is even more vital that mentors stay in touch with their small group projects and members as asynchronous meetings make it easy for members to feel isolated and fall behind.

Mentors are the life blood of RCOS, a mentor can help you with technical problems, show you where/how to find help for your project, and help you find a new project etc.

### Mentor Responsibilities
- Review project proposals at the start of the semester.
- Look after a small group of projects and their members as your mentees (usually ~2 mentors per small group).
    - Grade Status Updates for their mentees
    - Grade Mid-Year Reviews for their mentees 
- Help point students to what they need to do/where they need to go within RCOS.
- Ensure your mentees are on their schedule OR have documented reasons to be off their schedule.
- Set up whatever organization/goal structure you feel is best for helping students be successful with their open source contributions; this is what gives a small group personality.
- In general, help maintain the freedom and culture of RCOS and encourage open source contribution.

### To be a good mentor...
- Help mentees to reach their own goals.
- Talk directly to projects and mentees, understand what their project is and where you can help.
- Share ideas and contribute to development of RCOS as a whole - as long as you're monitoring the #mentors Discord channel you should have opportunities to contribute.

### Mentors should know...
- The grading rubric for Status Updates.
- Names and channels for referring mentees to Coordinators or Faculty Advisor.
- What resources are provided in the Handbook to direct mentees to.

<!-- ## Student Coordinators

Student Coordinators are mentors that organize the first couple weeks as well
as the large group meetings. If you're having an issue and your mentor can't
point you in the right direction, a Coordinator will be able to direct you
towards another mentor, Faculty Advisor or help you directly. -->

## External Mentors

External mentors are mentors that help projects remotely. External mentors serve a different role than regular student mentors.

In particular, they get the following exceptions:
- External mentors don't need to attend small and large group meetings
- External mentors don't need to understand the logistics of RCOS (students should ask their student mentors for this)

External mentors have their own sets of requirements, usually they provide a subset of the following responsibilities...
- Get students involved with industry or personal projects outside of RCOS
- Assist students with problems with a technology stack
- Introduce students to new technologies
- Provide advice to students regarding open source technologies
