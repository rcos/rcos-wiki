## Mentor Training Event(s)
Welcome to the RCOS mentor team! At the beginning of each semester, we hold mentor training sessions to help get our new mentors started.

Mentor training is required for all new mentors and returning mentors who have not mentored in at least 2 semesters and did not complete mentor training prior to becoming a mentor.

All other returning mentors are not required to attend mentor training, but are welcome to assist the Coordinators in facilitating mentor training.

External mentors are not required to complete mentor training, but are encouraged to review the mentor training slides.

## Topics Covered in Mentor Training
Below is a rough outline of what will be covered in the training sessions.

### Estimated Time Commitments
Bare minimum:
  - **Mentor training**: mandatory for all first-time mentors, optional for returning mentors (returning mentors may help facilitate training and/or answer any questions)
  - **Small group**: ~1-2 hours once or twice per week (Tuesdays and Fridays when large group is not in session).  
  - **Large group**: ~1-2 hours once or twice per month plus kick-off at beginning of semester and wrap-up at end of the semester.
  - **Mentor meetings**: biweekly, typically no longer than 30 mins-1 hour
  - **Code jams**: held once a month, you must host at least one
  - **Bonus sessions/casual coding sessions**: you must help out with at least one. At longer events such as coding sessions, hackathons, and code jams, you may sign up for a timeslot that only covers part of the session.

### First Two Weeks
The first two weeks agenda can be found [here](coordinating/agenda).

As a mentor, you are expected to help out with Project Pairing. If you have a course conflict on Tuesdays at 4pm (e.g. ECSE seminar), please let the Coordinators know so that:
  - your absence during these meetings can be marked as excused
  - you can be placed in an alternate small group (typically held at 6pm on Tuesday)

<!-- ### Using Observatory as a Mentor
  - Verification
  - Setting up a small group
  - Generating small group attendance codes -->

### Running Small Group
A brief overview of small group meetings for RCOS members can be found [here](meetings/small_group_meetings). Mentor training will additionally cover:
  - Tuesday vs. Friday small group
  - Running standup
  - Grading presentations

### Helping in Large Group
  - Managing noise levels/talking
  - Verifying members

### Handling Code of Conduct Violations
Please familiarize yourselves with our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) and [Bylaws](community/bylaws). As a mentor, you are not only expected to follow these, but to enforce them where appropriate.

Any violations warranting more than a verbal/Discord warning (e.g. repeated offenses, harassment) should be reported to Coordinators/Faculty Advisors, who will then determine the appropriate action(s) necessary.

### Q&A
Current mentors and Coordinators will be present at each training event to answer any questions you may have about mentorship.
