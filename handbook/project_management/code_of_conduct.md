Our **Community Code of Conduct** outlines some common ground rules all RCOS members are expected to abide by in order to make RCOS an inclusive experience for everyone. You can find the [RCOS Community Code of Conduct here](/code_of_conduct).

In addition to following the Community Code of Conduct, we strongly suggest that your project's repository includes a Code of Conduct as well. You can find a Code of Conduct template for your project that includes an abbreviated version of our Code of Conduct as well as space for any project-specific ground rules [here](/handbook/community/code_of_conduct_template). In addition, GitHub has instructions on including a Code of Conduct in your project [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/).
