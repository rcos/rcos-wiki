# Project Pitch

At the start of each semester, project leads that are looking for members can pitch their project to the entire RCOS community. This is a single slide show including:
- Project name
- Project lead(s)
- Very brief project description
- Project stack
- What kind of members you are looking for, e.g.
    - "Beginners are welcome"
    - "Python experience preferred"
    - "Graphic design experience preferred"
- Repository link *if existing project*

?> You do not have to pitch a project if you are working solo or have already found team members interested in joining.
