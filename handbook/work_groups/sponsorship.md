# Sponsorship Work Group
The goal of the Sponsorship Work Group is to maintain relationships with our existing sponsors and secure relationships with new companies and organizations that may be interested in providing RCOS with funds, cloud services, equipment, software licenses, or swag. Due to the monetary nature of sponsorship, the efforts of this work group will be managed with closer Faculty Advisor oversight than other Work Groups.

### Responsibilities
- Cultivate relationships with new sponsors
- Maintain relationships with existing sponsors
- Document a list of past and present sponsors, and their respective contributions
- Find creative ways to provide students with tangible benefits
