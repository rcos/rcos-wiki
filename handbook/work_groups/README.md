# Work Groups

Work Groups provide students flexible opportunities to develop their leadership skills and make meaningful contributions to growing and maintaining RCOS as a leading campus organization. All Work Group positions are volunteer based and members are free to leave at anytime, though students enrolled in RCOS are encouraged to finish out the semester when possible.

### Goals
The overarching goals of RCOS Work Groups are to:
- Provide opportunities for the broader RCOS community to have a role in running the organization
- Expand the reach of the organization and its ideals both inside and outside of RPI
- Reduce managerial overhead previously delegated exclusively to Coordinators

### RCOS Work Groups
- [Archival](/work_groups/archival.md)
- [Events Planning](/work_groups/events_planning.md)
- [Outreach](/work_groups/outreach.md)
- [Public Relations](/work_groups/public_relations.md)
- [Sponsorship](/work_groups/sponsorship.md)
- [Student Resources](/work_groups/student_resources.md)

This list should grow and change over time. Some groups may be combined or split up as their respective responsibilities evolve, and some groups may become inactive or defunct.

If you have an idea for a new Work Group, or would like to change an existing one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rcos/handbook/issues/new) and share your thoughts :)

### Requirements
All RCOS Work Groups must meet the following requirements each semester:
- Consist of at least one mentor (student or alumni) and one active student (2 member minimum)
- Must not exceed more than 8 members (keeps things manageable)
- Maintain their own dedicated Discord channel
- Produce at least one blog post  _per-group_ per-semester summarizing their efforts
- Meet **at least four times** during the semester as a team. Meetings may be held in-person or remotely.

### Joining a Work Group
Work Group positions are open to all RCOS students, alumni, and Faculty Advisors. Please consult the following steps to join a group:
- Fill out the [Work Group Sign Up](__TODO - add link to Google Form__) form
- Join the Work Group's Discord channel

### Leading a Work Group
Leading a Work Group requires more responsibility than simply being a member of one. Group leaders are expected to take ownership of the following duties:
- Defining and documenting the granular tasks the group will undertake during the semester
- Organizing meetings / calls
- Publishing minutes from group meetings
- Writing a brief evaluation of each work group member at the end of the semester

### Leaving a Work Group
By default, each Work Group's membership will reset at the beginning of each semester. Students are encouraged to continue their position into the next semester, but this is not a requirement. As all Work Group positions are volunteer based, a student may elect to leave a Work Group mid-semester - though they are encouraged to stay for the rest of the semester when possible.

### Defunct Work Groups
If there are no students or alumni available or willing to manage a Work Group, it should designated as _defunct_. Should a Work Group become defunct, the link to its documentation should be removed from the RCOS handbook's sidebar and moved into this section. This method enables future members find defunct groups and resurrect them if they desire.

**Defunct Work Groups**
- _No Defunct Work Groups yet :)_

### QUESTIONS
- TODO - where should meeting minutes be placed? GitHub repository, blog, emailed to Coordinators?
- TODO - where should the manifest of groups and respective members be maintained?
- TODO - create the `Work Group Sign Up` form and link it above
