# Outreach Work Group
The goals of the Outreach Work Group are to coordinate volunteer efforts and cultivate on-going relationships with the outside organizations these efforts benefit. While RCOS volunteer efforts may often be technical in nature, non-technical charitable work is also encouraged. Any external volunteer events can count as a bonus session with approval of a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor.

### Responsibilities
- Coordinate, schedule, and promote outside volunteer efforts
- Interface with local organizations that could benefit from RCOS student involvement
