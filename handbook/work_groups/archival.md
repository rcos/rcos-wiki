# Archival Work Group
The goals of the Archival Work Group are to create and maintain a record of the organization's history, membership, projects, structure, and milestones. As the resident historians of RCOS, members of the Archival Work Group will be tasked with preserving past artifacts while developing processes and procedures to archive future work.

### Responsibilities
- Curate lists of past mentors and Coordinators, organized by semester
- Maintain and augment a rolling repository of all past and present student projects
- Document a record of RCOS enrollment by semester (and perhaps visualize this data)
- Help maintain the organization of our Google Drive documents
- Continue the ongoing process of centralizing the above information into the RCOS Handbook
