> Grading only applies to students who enroll in RCOS for course credit. If you are participating for experience only (0 credits), you are not required to complete or submit any assignments or updates, nor is attendance required for you.

RCOS is largely a self-guided class, which can make management and grading difficult. Instructors assign appropriate grades using utilities such as [Observatory](https://rcos.io/) to track open source contributions and community involvement.

Generally speaking, if you're contributing to the community and/or making valuable open-source contributions you'll receive a high grade in RCOS.

## Guidelines

The rubric details what categories make up your grade. Please read through the guidelines for the grading categories below to know what is **required** and recommended for RCOS members each semester.

## Grade Appeal Policies

Every student taking RCOS for credit has an opportunity to appeal their final grade. The specific policies and process for appealing a grade are outlined below.

After grades are posted on SIS, you have a grace period of 7 days to request a grade appeal. The form to request a grade appeal will be posted on Discord. A Faculty Advisor will take a look and evaluate your appeal.
