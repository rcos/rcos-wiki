# Academic Integrity

## Overview
Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process. The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and The Graduate Student Supplement define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these if you are taking RCOS for credit. Guidelines for each portion of the course are listed below.

## Open Source Contributions and Additional Documentation
Students are allowed and encouraged to collaborate on open source contributions and reuse existing open source code, documentation, and graphics where permitted in the original project's license. 

Students may also engage in "pair programming" to work on open source contributions as long as they use co-authoring on all commits where pair programming was used. When using co-authoring, all students who worked on the commit must be included to receive credit for the commit. Instructions for co-authoring are listed below.
- [GitHub Commit Co-Authoring](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/)
- GitLab currently does not support co-authoring.


## Status Updates
All written status updates must be the student’s own work. If you are referencing someone else’s work (e.g. a tutorial on an issue you have been having), you must give proper attribution and link to the work in your status update.

Submission of a status update that is not a student’s own work will result in a 0 on the first status update where a violation is detected. If there is a subsequent infraction the student will receive a grade of F for the course and will be referred to the Dean of Students. Students who fail RCOS for academic integrity infractions are also ineligible to mentor for RCOS in current or future semesters.


## Attendance
Attendance codes are given during all RCOS small group, large group, and bonus sessions through Venue or Submitty. 

As much as we value sharing and openness, we also value integrity. Thus, we ask that you do not distribute attendance codes to people who are not currently attending the session or attempt to attend a session where you are not present. 

All students who dishonestly log attendance will receive an unexcused absence which cannot be made up with a bonus session. Repeated infractions will result in a referral to the Dean of Students.

If you know in advance you will not be able to make an RCOS meeting, or unforeseen circumstances arise that make you unable to attend, please review our [Excused Absence Policy](/grading/attendance?id=excused-absence-policy) instead of attempting to enter an attendance code. Excused absences will not count against your attendance grade.
