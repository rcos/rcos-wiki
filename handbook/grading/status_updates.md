# Status Update Guidelines

## Overview

**What are Status Updates?**

Status Updates are weekly updates submitted by members detailing what they have done in the past week, what they plan to do next week, and what technical blockers they've encountered. These are intended to keep members on track to completing their goals, and are used by Coordinators and mentors to pinpoint who is falling behind and might need assistance.

**How are Status Updates tracked?**

Currently, a Submitty gradeable is created for a Status Update each week, and members are expected to upload a **text** file in either plaintext, markdown, or similar format. PDFs are also accepted. Word documents are **not allowed** as Submitty cannot display them. Students are automatically enrolled into the RCOS Submitty course at the start of the semester.

**How are Status Updates graded?**

Your Status Updates are factored into your final year grade. See the [Grading Rubric](grading/rubric) for details.

## Requirements

We ask that each Status Update comprise the following parts. **Each part must be included even if you have nothing to report for that section. Simply state "Nothing to report" or similar.**

#### 0: Intro
State your name and project.

#### 1: This Week
Summarize what you have contributed in the past week. This includes code, documentation, learning, etc. Remember that someone reading might not be familiar with your project, so give context. If you're unsure how much detail to give, lean on the more detailed side.

#### 2: Next Week
Summarize what you plan on doing next week. We aren't holding you to this, but we want you to at least think about it each week.

#### 3: Blockers
List any *technical* blockers you have hit when trying to work on your project. This **does not** include things outside of RCOS that prevented you from getting work done, i.e. "I had a test this week so I couldn't do work"


#### 4: Links
List direct links to your contributions and any resources you were using for learning. Mentors need to be able to see proof of your work by following these links. Links to your commits, issues, etc. are desirable.

### Wes Turner
#### Project Unk

**This Week**<br>This week I investigated the 19 projects in RCOS for the Summer and I settled on the Unk project. I am currently the sole contributor. I wrote the proposal and created the project in github. I also opened an issue laying out the plan for next week. 

**Next Week**<br>Next week I plan to create some storyboards describing User/System interactions and begin to create a UI design. I will also begin surveying my community to put together a potential advisory list.

**Blockers**<br>There are currently no technical blockers.
