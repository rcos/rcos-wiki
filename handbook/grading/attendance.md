# Attendance Guidelines

<!-- **TODO** - we need to establish a threshold percentage that must be fulfilled by regular, non-bonus session attendance. The reason for this threshold is to ensure that bonus sessions are used to fill gaps in attendance, rather than supplement a significant portion of the requirement. -->

## Overview

Being part of the RCOS community means seeing what RCOS members are doing, giving feedback, and learning from tech talks and guest speakers.

Attendance at RCOS is required for:
- all small group meetings
- all mandatory large group meetings
- at least 1 workshop session

You may miss up to two meetings (small or large group combined) without an excuse and can make up an additional two meetings by attending more than the required number of bonus, work, or workshop sessions. 

Unexcused absences beyond those allowed will impact your grade.
We understand that there are occasional conflicts that require you to be absent from an RCOS meeting without a formal excuse.
Please see a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor prior to any conflicts to make arrangements.

## Bonus Sessions
Unexcused absences can be made up by attending bonus sessions. Bonus sessions can be fulfilled by attending any of the following events:

- [Casual Coding Sessions](/events/casual_coding_sessions)
- [Tech Talks](/events/tech_talks)
- [Code Jams](/events/code_jams)
- [Hackathons](/events/hackathons)
- [Accepted Students Day](/events/accepted_students_day)

Pay attention in [Large Group Meetings](/meetings/large_group_meetings) to hear Bonus Session announcements!

## Excused Absence Policy
Excused absences can be given for any of the following:
* Illnesses / injuries
* Family emergencies
* Job interviews
* Graduate school visits
* Religious holidays
* Conferences
* External hackathons
* Schedule conflicts with courses, exams, or extracurriculars
  * In order to receive an excused absence, this conflict must take place during your scheduled large or small group session.

The above list is not exhaustive. If you are unsure about what constitutes an excused absence, please reach out to a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor. However, excused absences will **not** be given if you are removed from a meeting for violating our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or our [Bylaws](community/bylaws.md).

Excused absences do **not** need to be made up with a bonus session (but you are encouraged to come to bonus sessions regardless!).

### Requesting Excused Absences

Currently, in order to request an excused absence, you must contact a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor.

For foreseen absences (e.g. hackathons, conferences, job/grad school interviews, etc), this must be done at least 48 hours in advance of the first session you will miss.

For unforeseen absences (e.g. illness, family emergency), this must be done within 1 week of returning to RCOS.

For extenuating circumstances, please speak to a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor directly.

In the future, functionality will be implemented to request excused absences!
