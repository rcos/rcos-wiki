# Bylaws

Our Bylaws are an extension of our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The Bylaws apply to RCOS meetings at RPI, including large group and small group meetings as well as bonus sessions, casual coding sessions, and any project meetings unless otherwise noted.

## Summary
- Respect speakers by not talking or making excessive noise while they are speaking. ([Noise](#noise))
- Be mindful of your audience when choosing a topic for your talk. ([Talks/Sensitive Topics](#sensitive-topics))
- Please keep any messages you send to a live demo professional and appropriate. ([Talks/Live Demos](#live-demos))
- You may use electronics during large group talks as long as you respect the people around you. ([Large Group/Electronics](#electronics))
- Some speakers may also ask that you close all laptops unless you are following along or taking notes.
- If you are an RPI student, you are also expected to comply with the [RPI Student Handbook](https://sexualviolence.rpi.edu/sites/default/files/Rensselaer%20Handbook%20of%20Student%20Rights%20%26%20Responsibilities%2C%20November%202017.pdf).
- Appropriate [consequences](#consequences-of-code-of-conduct-violations) may follow if you violate the Code of Conduct, Bylaws, or RPI Student Handbook. 

## Noise
An important part of RCOS is being able to hear from both fellow RCOS members and guest speakers. We ask that you please refrain from talking or making excessive noise while a speaker is talking as it can be disruptive to the speaker and to your peers.

## Talks

### Sensitive Topics

Please keep in mind that students, alumni, and Faculty Advisors are from a diverse range of backgrounds will be viewing your talk. In addition, students are required to attend a certain number of talks per semester.

Presentations containing detailed discussion of sensitive, upsetting, or controversial topics without warning can create an especially hostile environment when this is considered.

Presentations should not include any content that:
* Violates our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT)
* Encourages unethical behavior, including but not limited to the use of open source technology for malicious purposes
* Contains any of the following:
  * Graphic violence or descriptions of violence
  * Detailed and explicit discussions of potentially triggering topics (e.g. suicide, sexual assault, addiction, self-harm)
  * Excessive profanity
  * Nudity

If you're unsure about whether or not your talk conforms to the above guidelines, please reach out to a mentor or Coordinator to discuss.

### Live Demos

Live demos can provide a way to make otherwise dry talks very engaging, especially in a larger setting. However, inappropriate content sent to the live demo may reflect poorly on the speaker and RCOS as a whole. Thus, we ask that the audience comply with the Code of Conduct and Bylaws in any content they send to a live demo. We also ask that the speaker rehearse live demos in advance and ensure that no sensitive data is visible to users of the live demo.

## Large Group
During our large group sessions, we have the following policies.

### Electronics
RCOS likes to maintain a culture of freedom. If you choose to use your laptop or mobile device during large group presentations, you may do so as long as you are mindful of the people around you. This includes:

* Muting all audio
* Not participating in audio or video calls
* Ensuring any material that may be visible on your screen is SFW (safe for work)
* Keeping mobile devices on "Silent" or "Vibrate"
* Using a quiet keyboard instead of a loud keyboard

In addition, some speakers may ask audience members to put away all mobile devices and close all laptops unless they are using them to actively follow along or take notes. If a speaker does so, please respect their request.

If you absolutely must take a phone call, you can exit the lecture hall to make/take a phone call. If you need to call emergency services for any reason, you may remain in the room while you make the call.

## Consequences of Code of Conduct Violations
If you violate the RCOS Community Code of Conduct or Bylaws, appropriate consequences will follow at the discretion of Faculty Advisors. In addition, if you are an RPI student, you must also comply with all policies in the [RPI Student Handbook](https://sexualviolence.rpi.edu/sites/default/files/Rensselaer%20Handbook%20of%20Student%20Rights%20%26%20Responsibilities%2C%20November%202017.pdf).
