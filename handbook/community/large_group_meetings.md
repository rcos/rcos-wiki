# Large Group Meetings

!> Large group format has been revised while remote learning is in effect.

## Frequency
Each online meeting starts in a Faculty Advisors WebEx meeting with the entire class. Coordinators and Faculty Advisors present the day's slideshow including announcements, reminders, deadlines, etc. Meetings are recorded and posted shortly after for anyone to view.

## Announcements
Each meeting's slides have an announcements section where Coordinators/Faculty Advisors announce important events both in RCOS and external. RCOS members who have interesting announcements about external events or anything else they feel worth sharing with everyone can ask a Coordinator to briefly talk during the large group meeting. Don't be hesitant to, we heavily encourage participation!

## Guest Speakers
RCOS welcomes guest speakers to present their work or research and how it encorporates open-source software. Every once in a while a guest speaker will be given time to present during a large group meeting for everyone. These can be anyone from RPI faculty to external companies. These will be announced ahead of time.

## Closing Ceremony
- Coordinators select 2-3 projects to give a very brief highlights reel on their accomplishments in the semester
- New Coordinators are introduced
- ~~Pizza is delivered for everyone~~ ;(

<!-- IN PERSON FORMAT BELOW -->
<!-- ## Overview
- What are large group meetings?
- Where / when do we meet?

## Frequency

During the first two weeks of the semester, large group occurs every Tuesday and Friday to get new community members acquainted with RCOS and to inform existing members on changes in structure and mentorship.

Once all community members are assigned to a small group, large group will only occur on one or two Fridays per month. All other Fridays are reserved for workshops on open-source technologies hosted by the RCOS community.

Large group will also occur on the last Friday of the semester for our closing ceremony. 

## Announcements
Meetings begin with announcements. It's an opportunity for the Coordinators to introduce the meeting's speakers & presentations. Any RCOS member is welcome to make an annoucement at the beginning of a meeting (in fact, it's encouraged!).

## Lightning Talks and Sick Picks
  - Lightning Talks are brief talks on anything related to open source.
  - Sick Picks are opportunities to share some open-source technology you have been using.
  - Both Lightning Talks and Sick Picks must contain only 1 slide and may not go over 2 minutes.

## Guest Speakers
RCOS welcomes guest speakers to present their work or research and how it encorporates open-source software.
