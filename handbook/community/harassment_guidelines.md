- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like `*hug*` or `*backrub*`) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes

- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others

- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other RCOS community members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- Publication of non-harassing private communication without the other party's consent

- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”

- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions
