# Frequently Asked Questions

## What do you do in RCOS?
In a semester of RCOS, you work with a team (or solo) on an open source project. You can either start your own project and manage a team of students, or join a project and work under a project lead.

## What kind of course credit can you receive?
You can register for RCOS for 3 or 4 free elective credits. You can request to take less credits if necessary. You can also take RCOS for 0 credits - for experience only - for no obligation for attendance and contributions.

## How often does RCOS meet?
RCOS meets twice each week for two hours on Tuesdays and Fridays, typically from 4pm to 6pm, where attendance is required. There are also other one-off meetings and events held throughout the semester where attendance is optional.

## How much time is expected per week?
You are expected to work on your RCOS project at minimum the 4-hours a week that the course meets. If you are taking RCOS for credit, you are expected to work for a few more hours each week based on your credit count. If you are taking RCOS for no credit, you are encouraged to work consistently each week but are not under obligation to do so.

## What kind of projects can I work on?
The only requirement for an RCOS project is that it be open source. While we mostly have software projects, hardware projects are welcome and encouraged. Projects range from full stack web apps, native applications, mobile applications, video games, programming languages, and more. Check out [rcos.io/projects](https://rcos.io/projects) for a full list!

## Do I have to finish my project?
No! RCOS looks for consistent work, not a fully-fledged, completed project at the end of the semester. You are graded by how consistently you worked with your team towards the milestones you set at the start of the semester. We recognize plans change and sometimes fail! As a result, you can work on the same project multiple semesters, and we encourage project leads to do so.

## Do I need Computer Science experience to join?
You do not need any prior programming/hardware/CS experience to join RCOS and all majors are welcome. However, different projects will require different levels of experience from their members. There are often many projects each semester that welcome beginners and are willing to teach members how to get started and contribute. There are also workshops held by members throughout each semester on different technologies, frameworks, languages, etc. to learn from.

## What are some successful RCOS projects?
[YACS](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS), in development since 2010, lets students create course schedules. [Venue](https://github.com/TheStopsign/Venue) is a classroom management tool that integrates QR Code based attendance and enforces asynchronous lecture recording playback. [Observatory](https://github.com/observatory-server) is RCOS's primary class management tool. All our past and present student projects can be viewed on [RCOS Observatory](https://rcos.io)

## Why is RCOS a unique RPI organization?
RCOS is a student-run organization that allows students to not only work on what interests them but also receive course credit for it.
