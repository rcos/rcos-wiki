# How to join RCOS

If you're an RPI student, hop in on our first meeting of the semester or join [our Discord](https://rcos-discord.herokuapp.com/) and introduce yourself! Feel free to ask questions to anyone, especially Mentors, Coordinators, and Faculty Advisors.

If you're looking to get involved with RCOS as a member outside of RPI, email a [Coordinator](mailto:coordinators@rcos.io) to get setup on the [RCOS Discord](#discord). In the meantime, you can create an account and fill in your profile on [Observatory](#observatory).

<!-- RCOS is a group of RPI students who work on open source projects. Our members work on a variety of projects, which can be seen on the projects page. To see the presentation schedule look here. -->

<!-- Benefits of being an RCOS member -->
<!-- - The opportunity to help society by creating useful software. -->
<!-- - An excellent environment to share your skills with your peers and learn from them as well -->
<!-- - Great practice in the code review process, a very important skill for your software career! -->
<!-- - Practice giving and receiving feedback. Learning how to discuss technical and non-technical aspects of a project in a constructive fashion is a critical skill that employers look for! -->

<!-- Students can participate in RCOS for course credit or for a stipend. At the beginning of each semester, the Internal Advisory Board will review project proposals and decide which projects should receive financial support. -->

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is where most RCOS projects are stored and collaborated on within. You will need to create an account and eventually create or join a project. Some projects do choose another platform such as GitLab, BitBucket, etc.

## Observatory

[Observatory](https://rcos.io) is RCOS's open source project management platform. Every RCOS member is required to have an observatory account, it's through this platform that you can write blog posts, record your attendance and see other RCOS projects.

## Discord

[Discord](https://rcos-discord.herokuapp.com/) is the primary communication platform for RCOS. We created a tool to link your RPI identity to your Discord account (only for our server of course!) and create categories and channels for small groups and projects each semester. Here you'll be able to reach out to Faculty Advisors, Coordinators, Mentors, and your fellow members!

<!-- ## Finding a project

[GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) allows you to explore GitHub and find awesome open source projects to contribute to. Spend a good amount of time finding a project that you like. Don't be intimidated! Many projects that seem very complicated are actively looking for new contributors and will give you "easy" issues to get started. You'll learn fast! Feel free to tackle issues as a team. -->
