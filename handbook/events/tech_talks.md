# Tech Talks

## Overview
- What are Tech Talks?
- Criteria / Requirements

## Signing Up For Tech Talks
Anyone can give a tech talk, whether you are a current RCOS member or from a company. 

At the beginning of each semester, there will be a spreadsheet with time slots. Any time slot marked as a Member Talk is open for a tech talk.

## Format

Tech talks can be longer than typical RCOS presentations, with a recommended maximum length of 10-15 minutes. If you would like to have a talk for longer than this, consider hosting a [bonus session](events/hosting) instead.

## Topics

Tech talks can be about anything technical (or non-technical), within reasonable limits defined by our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) and [Bylaws](community/bylaws). Some past tech talks can be found below.
