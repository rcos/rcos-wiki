## What is NRB?

Navigating Rensselaer and Beyond (NRB) is RPI's welcome week for new freshmen. It is an opportunity for freshmen to learn about the resources available to them as well as extracurriculars and courses, and to bond with their new classmates.

<!-- ## RCOS NRB Event

This year, RCOS will be holding a brief NRB event on Tuesday, August 28 from 12pm-1:45pm in AE 217. This will be an opportunity for new freshmen, regardless of major, to meet current RCOS students and learn about open source as well as our community and projects.

If you are a current student and would like to sign up to help with NRB, please let one of our Coordinators know by **August 21** as we have limited spots. -->
