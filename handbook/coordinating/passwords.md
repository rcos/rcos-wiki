# Passwords

It is imperative that RCOS infrastructure and social media accounts are always accessible to Coordinators and Faculty Advisors from a secure, centralized location. We currently use [BitWarden](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/vault) for this.

### Access to BitWarden Vault

Coordinators must be securely sent the username and password combination to the BitWarden account upon becoming a Coordinator. This account grants access to all other RCOS accounts so naturally it must be kept extremely secure.

### New RCOS Accounts

Coordinators in the past used personal accounts for RCOS infrastructure. Once they graduated, succeeding Coordinators lost access and sometimes even knowledge of those important accounts. Therefore, it is imperative that **personal accounts are NEVER used for RCOS infrastructure or social media** but instead use the `rcos.management@gmail.com` email and are added to the RCOS BitWarden vault.
