# First Two Weeks Agenda

The first two weeks is an extremely important time to get new students acquainted with RCOS, old students updated on any changes in structure/leadership, assigning mentors and a handful of other tasks. This is the most important time for the Coordinators to be "on top of things".

## Before the First Meeting
Prior to the first meeting, mentors and new Coordinators should be chosen. Any planned changes should be reflected in the relevant documentation and/or presentations. The Coordinators should meet to plan and make sure all administrative affairs are in order.

In addition, at least one [mentor training session](mentoring/training) must take place prior to the first meeting.

## Outline
All of the following details need to be worked out within the first two weeks
* RCOS Concepts
  - History Reviewed
  - Structure, Grading and Motivations introduced
  - Sponsors introduced
  - Small groups introduced
  - Semester Goals introduced
  - Presentation rules and guidelines
* Old Projects Pitched
* New Projects Pitched
* Project Pairing

## First Meeting

The first meeting is to be held on the first Tuesday or Friday of classes, whichever comes first.

The first meeting begins with the [introduction slides](https://gitpitch.com/rcos/rcos-handbook/master?p=slides/intro), presented by the student Coordinators. The slides go through the stucture of RCOS and how to participate. A Faculty Advisor will then give a talk on the [history](/overview/history) of RCOS, and briefly explain some administrative details.

After the intro talk, mentors are announced and given the chance to introduce themselves. Mentors should say a few sentences about themselves and what experience they have.

The expectations of working on a project for credit are defined. The rubric is explained with emphasis on changes / improvements from the previous year based on feedback from students and mentors. Coordinators should be careful not to sound stringent or cold, while making clear that working on a project for credit does require a commitment and the students' best effort.

After expectations are defined, students are reminded how to pitch their projects the following meeting. Pitch slides are collected by a Coordinator until 11:59PM the night before the second meeting.

Existing projects are reminded to submit proposals. Existing projects are asked to fill out a form expressing their small group mentor/technology preference.

After the first meeting, another mentor training session will be held for any new mentors who have not completed mentor training.

## Second Meeting

The second meeting is dedicated solely to project pitches. Each pitch should be no more than one minute long, although exceptions are sometimes made for 'special' projects.

Additional information should be kept to the minimum. Students should be encouraged to get in touch with project leaders and mentors for help picking a project, and should be reminded of the URP form deadlines.

If a significant number of new mentors have still not completed mentor training, another mentor training session will take place after the second meeting if time allows. 

## Third Meeting

!> The process for Project Pairing and proposal approving now occurs asynchronously due to remote learning.

The third meeting has two parts that occur simultaneously: [Project Pairing](membership/project_pairing) and proposal approval. The mentors should be split evenly between the two events, with each occuring in its own room. Finding a project can be very nervewracking for newcomers, so Project Pairing is intended to ensure every student finds a project.

In the second room, mentors should be present to look over student's proposals and approve them. If a proposal does not meet the guidelines, mentors should assist the project members in modifying their proposal.

**Every for-credit student must have a project with an approved proposal by the end of the fourth meeting.**

## Prior to the Fourth Meeting

Mentor groups should selected and rooms should be assigned prior to the fourth meeting. Each mentor group should have its own room. Projects should be distributed amongst mentor groups as evenly as possible. Projects should be assigned to mentors with relevant skill sets so the mentors can best provide technical assistance when needed. All students should be informed of their mentor groups prior to the fourth meeting. If the fourth meeting is a Tuesday, students should report directly to their mentor group.

Projects with 8 or more members may be split between mentor groups.

At least one mentor meeting excluding mentor training must occur prior to the fourth meeting. Mentors should be instructured to ensure that mentees:
1. Are on [rcos.io](https://rcos.io).
2. Are on [Discord](https://rcos-discord.herokuapp.com/)

Any larger goals for the year should be made clear and a schedule for mentor meetings should be set.
