# Welcome to RCOS!

The **Rensselaer Center for Open Source** - or **RCOS** (*`ar-kos`*) for short - is a community of motivated students at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu) who develop open source projects under the guidance of experienced instructors and student mentors.

### Our Mission Statement

> To cultivate an inclusive, creative, and entrepreneurial community that seeks to empower students to develop open-source solutions to real-world problems.

### What do we do?
RCOS members collaborate on open source projects throughout the semester. Members may participate as students pursuing free elective course credit, or recreationally for experience. At the beginning of each semester, members may propose an outline for a new or existing project, or join a project proposed by another member. Members enrolled for credit must regularly be in attendance, produce regular progress updates, and give a final presentation.

All members are encouraged to produce successful projects, but the primary goals are to be exposed to interesting ideas, technologies, and people while gaining practical experience outside of the classroom in a low-risk environment.

RCOS is an active member of the [Mozilla Open Source Student Network](https://opensource.mozilla.community/) and is the first student run organization to be accepted as an associate member of the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). With an enrolled membership of 200+ students and over 800 alumni, RCOS is the largest open source campus organization in the country.
