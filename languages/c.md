[C (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C (programming language))

C is a low-level systems programming language originally designed in
order to create the [UNIX](/topics/unix) operating system. It has been
popular for many years and as such a lot of important code is written in
it. C is known for being a relatively small language that gives
programmers a lot of power, but also requires them to do many things,
such as memory management, for themselves.

[C++](/languages/cpp) is an expansion on C with a number of major
changes.
