C is a low-level systems programming language originally designed in order to create the [[topics:unix|UNIX]] operating system.
It has been popular for many years and as such a lot of important code is written in it.
C is known for being a relatively small language that gives programmers a lot of power,
but also requires them to do many things, such as memory management, for themselves.

[C++](/languages/cpp) is an expansion on C with a number of major changes.
