# C++

**Website**: [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++)

Pronounced like \"see plus plus\" and commonly also referred to as
\"CPP\".

C++ is a high-performance systems programming language that was
initially designed as an expansion on the [C programming
language](/languages/c). Since then it has grown to being a distinct and
powerful language that is still a superset of C.
