Python is an extremely popular interpreted language well known for being relatively easy to program in. As such it has gained a major following with libraries available for every task. Notably the scientific and data analytics communities use Python very heavily.

There are two major versions of Python the 2.7.x and the 3.x series that are somewhat incompatible with each other. The 2.7.x series is outdated and will soon be deprecated, but is maintained for legacy reasons. The 3.x series is the up-to-date version and is what you should use.
